- ### Anti-AFK
  - This script will look for an active Roblox process, focus it, clicks the center of the window, and returns to the previously active window (if any), repeats every 15 minutes
- ### Sound notifier
  - For when the above described auto-clicker is about to repeat its loop
  - I unfortunately cannot control how loud the beeps are (at least with my current knowledge on AHK), **they can be loud in some headsets/speakers!**
- ### Easy to use interface
  - No keybinds involved. Simply toggle the auto-clicker and continue with what you were doing!
- ### Progress bar & time tracking
  - See how long until the next auto-click!
> [!NOTE]
> This script is the first *real* project I've put together since learning a bit of AHK. As a result, a lot of what you'll find may be unoptimized or sloppy.
