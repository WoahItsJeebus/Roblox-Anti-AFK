> ## This script **<ins>requires</ins>** [AutoHotKey v2](https://autohotkey.com/download/ahk-v2.exe)

# <p align=center><ins>**Features**</ins></p>
- <ins>Anti-AFK</ins> > This script will look for an active Roblox process, focus it, clicks the center of the window, and returns to the previously active window (if any), repeats every 15 minutes
- <ins>Sound notifier</ins> for when the above described auto-clicker is about to repeat its loop
  - I unfortunately cannot control how loud the beeps are (at least with my current knowledge on AHK), **they can be loud in some headsets/speakers!**
- <ins>Easy to use interface</ins>, no keybinds involved. Simply toggle the auto-clicker and continue with what you were doing!
- <ins>Progress bar & time tracking</ins> > See how long until the next auto-click!
> [!NOTE]
> This script is the first *real* project I've put together since learning a bit of AHK. As a result, a lot of what you'll find may be unoptimized or sloppy.

> [!CAUTION]
> Bugs may occur when searching for the Windows Store version of Roblox.
> As this is my very first real project in this language, bugs can occur at any point. Relaunching the script or using an earlier build may circumvent these bugs.
