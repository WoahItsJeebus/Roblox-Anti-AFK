> [!IMPORTANT]
> This script requires [AutoHotKey v2](https://autohotkey.com/download/ahk-v2.exe)

> [!NOTE]
> This script is the first *real* project I've put together since learning a bit of AHK. As a result, a lot of what you'll find may be unoptimized or sloppy.

> [!CAUTION]
> Bugs may occur when searching for the Windows Store version of Roblox.
> As this is my very first real project in this language, bugs can occur at any point. Relaunching the script or using an earlier build may circumvent these bugs.
